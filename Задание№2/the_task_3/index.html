            <h2>About pet</h2>
            <p>The dog is clever. It is the only pet who knows its master and the friends of his family. Its knows the master by his voice and even by his looks.
                The dog is a good companion and true friend. It will guard your life. It will work for you if you train him. It will hunt for you. It will play with you.
                All dogs were wild once. They belonged to the same family as the wolf and the fox. But people tamed them, and now dogs are useful to man.
                There are many kinds of dogs and  you can read about some of them.</p>
